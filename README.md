# sqlalchemy-challenge
Module 10 challenge!
Hello again!

Another day, another assignment very late.

Most of the work here has been derived from class excercises.

The queries are entirely my own work, however there is a snippet of code required to format the data in the jupyter notebook file to be used by the charts, it's been taken off stackoverflow.
Honestly quite hand, given the ridiculous return.
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9486180/sql-alchemy-orm-returning-a-single-column-how-to-avoid-common-post-processing

Other than that, all my work!

I'm feeling at least more confident this is gonna get done now!
